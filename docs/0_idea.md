# Course project idea

Evelyn Griffith

## Title

Jabberwocky 2.0

## Description of project

The goal for this project is to have the computer write a poem with words from three different novels (of my choosing). Then I want the computer to mix up those words so that they arent really words anymore and print them as a new poem that will resemble the otherworldly, strange concept behind the Jabberwocky poem the Lewis Carol wrote. 

### If you plan to use any data sources, what are they and why?

The data sources that I plan to use are "Pride and Prejudice" - Jane Austen, "Aesop's Fables", and "Anderson's Fairy Tales" - by H.C. Anderson. I want to use these because they all hold sentimental value and I think that they have interesting language. I also chose these because they were available for download on Project Gutenberg. 

### Tentative description of ideal output

I want the computer to produce a poem, with a set number of lines, and a specific line format that I will write through the code. I want it to create words that are not real words, but are still somehow readable. The goal is to create a Dr. Seuss and Jabberwocky inspired poem that somehow reads well and invokes some sort of feeling while having words that are completely unintelligable in some cases. 

## Statement of motivation/interest

I have always loved Lewis Carol's "Jabberwocky". My dad read it to me when I was little and I was fascinated that Lewis Carol could use words that were completely made up, but they still got his point across. I am curious if I can make a computer produce something similar, hence the title for my project, "Jabberwocky 2.0"

## Perceived or realized challenges

I think that there will be a lot of challenges with this project if I complete it the right way. I am really concerned that the words wont be readible at all because they wont always contain vowels, but I think that I can get the computer to recognize the vowels and maybe include one or two in each word that it mixes up, but that feels like an advanced concept to me. I am also concerned that without words like "in", "and", and "the", the poem will make absolutely no sense, so I am hoping that I can maybe alter the lines of the poem so that they include these words. Those are only two of the prospective challenges that I think I will face with this idea, but somehow I still think it could be doable.
