# Course project final report

Evelyn Griffith

## Final title

Jabberwocky2.0

## If you used any data sources, what were they and why?

I have four data sources. three of them are books. They are Pride and Prejudice - Jane Austen, H.C. Anderson's Fairy Tales, and Aesop's Fables. I chose these three books because they were all accessible and have significant meaning to me. As for why I needed them from a technical standpoint, my project requires that I take text from already existing books in order to mix it up. The fourth data source that I used it technically one that I generated. I figured out that if I generate the text jumbled up, then I can just use another python document to draw on the jumbled up text and format it. So I would also call 'Jabberwocky' in my data folder a data source as well.

## How did the final project end up? Were you able to achieve your ideal (or close to it)?

I think the final project worked exactly the way I wanted it to. I acieved my goal which was to create a nonsensical poem that would be randomly generated from words that exist in three different novels and that is exactly how it worked out.

## Did your project change over time? If so, how?

I dont think my project really changed, the only thing that didnt turn out exactly the way that I envision was the format of the poem, but I only specified a poem format which I think can mean a lot of different things. 

## Describe your approaches and experience with the project.

### What worked?

Well, I was able to successfully retrieve, jumble up, and print out the words from three different novels and have them paste into another document to be called a poem. I was pleased with the final result.

### What didn't?

I can't get the poem to be gramatically correct, so it's pretty much just nonsense.

### What would you have done differently?

Honestly, I dont think there is anything that I would do differently, this project worked out way better than I was expecting.


### What was the biggest challenge that you overcame? How did you do it?

The biggest challenge I faced was definitely the formatting of the poem. I figured out how to do it, but in a somwehat unconventional way. I actually have two files that hold my code. Essentially what I did, is I created the code that would generate the text from the three books in a mixed up way. Thn I used a seperate code file to call on that document and use the words from it to print out a poem. This was a much easier way for me to format it because I could use methods that we used in class to generate the poem. Overall, I definitely spent the most time on trying to figure out how to format the poem all within the same file, and I think it worked out nicely that I was able to generate the right code. The file that is 'testing.py' is the file to run to generate a Jabberwocky2.0 poem. if you run the 'main.py' file you will get Jabberwocky which can be found in the data folder and that holds all of the jumbled up text that is called upon by the testing.py file.
