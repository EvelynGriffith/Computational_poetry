# Course project progress

## Using a Markdown `list`, detail the tasks you've completed and describe your progress.

* I imported three different novels
* I wrote a code that reads the files, and takes words from them
* I wrote code that takes those words and scrambles them apart from a few select words that are in a 'keeps' list. 
* I got the program to print the scrambled words in another file in the same format as the book, but with mixed up lines so that all three books are mixed together. 

I think I have accomplished a lot and I am relatively close to meeting my goal. The only other thing that I really need to do is format the text so that I can read it like a poem.

## Using a Markdown `list`, detail the tasks you still have yet to do. Where are you stuck? Where do you need help?

* I need to write code that formats the scrambled text into a poem.
* I need to limit the amount of text that is shown in the file so that it knows that it doesnt need to take ALL of the words from the text in order to write the poem. I only need 500 words or more.

I think I am almost done. 

## Celebrate your successes. What are they?

I am really proud that I was able to get the words to scramble the right way in such a way that they are still somewhat readible and I am also happy that I got the words to print out again in a seperate file while keeping certain words the same. That is more complex than anything I would have thought myself capapble of, so I am proud of that.
